# Mastra

> Mastra is an open-source TypeScript agent framework designed to provide the essential primitives for building AI applications. It enables developers to create AI agents with memory and tool-calling capabilities, implement deterministic LLM workflows, and leverage RAG for knowledge integration. With features like model routing, workflow graphs, and automated evals, Mastra provides a complete toolkit for developing, testing, and deploying AI applications.

This documentation covers everything from getting started to advanced features, APIs, and best practices for working with Mastra's agent-based architecture.

The documentation is organized into key sections:
- **docs**: Core documentation covering concepts, features, and implementation details
- **examples**: Practical examples and use cases demonstrating Mastra's capabilities
- **showcase**: A showcase of applications built using Mastra

Each section contains detailed markdown files that provide comprehensive information about Mastra's features and how to use them effectively.
